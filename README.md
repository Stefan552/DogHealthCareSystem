## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Dog Health Care System, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The application relies on Java, so make sure you have it installed.
- **MySQL Database Server**: A MySQL server is required to store and manage dog health data.
- **MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver)**: You need this to connect the application to the MySQL database.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Database Setup

2. Set Up the MySQL Database:

   - Create a MySQL database named "DogHealthDB".
   - Create a table named "DogHealthRecords" with columns "dog_name," "age," "weight," "vaccination_status," "last_checkup_date," and "owner_name." Here's a sample SQL command to create the table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE DogHealthRecords (
       dog_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       age INT,
       weight DECIMAL(5, 2),
       vaccination_status VARCHAR(50),
       last_checkup_date DATE,
       owner_name VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ```

   - You can use a MySQL client or a tool like phpMyAdmin to execute this SQL command.

3. Configure Database Connection:

   - Open the `AppController.java` file.
   - Modify the `jdbcUrl`, `dbUsername`, and `dbPassword` variables to match your database configuration.
